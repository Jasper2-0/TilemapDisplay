TilemapDisplay
==============

A set of VVVV patches that can display tilemaps such as used in online mapping services such as Google Maps, Open Street Maps etc.

Please note that this patch is missing a subdir called 'tiles', which holds an unpacked TileMill render. (image pyramid with levels 0-8)
